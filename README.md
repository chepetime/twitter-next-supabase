# Twitter Clone with the Next.js App Router and Supabase

This repository contains a simple clone of Twitter using Next.js, Typescript, Supbase and Tailwind

## Getting Started

Install the correct version of node using the `.nvmrc` file, which has the latest version available.

```sh
nvm use
```

Then use pnpm to install the node dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

Finally, copy the environment variables. Don't forget to add your own variables.

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then start the local server as usual:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```
